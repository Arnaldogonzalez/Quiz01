b-A way to define a custom element or attribute.

2-Write the JavaScript code necessary to create a controller named "PageController" which prints the string "hello world" as soon as the page loads and the controller runs.

3-Given the following angular module declaration:

How do you bind this angular module to a particular portion of your html page (for instance the body tag)?

4-Write a recursive function which receives an array and returns the sum of the elements of the array.

5-Given two temperatures, return true if one is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.
a.	icyHot(120, -1) → true
					 function icyHot(temp1, temp2){
                                             if(temp1 < 0 && temp2 > 100 || temp1 > 100 && temp2 < 0) return true
					     else{ return false;

                                          }
					}
b.	icyHot(-1, 120) → true
c.	icyHot(2, 120) → false

6-Given 2 ints, a and b, return true if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.

					function makes10(a, b){
					    if(a === 10 || b === 10 || (a + b) === 10) return true;
				    	    else{ return false;
				    	}
				     }
a.	makes10(9, 10) → true
b.	makes10(9, 9) → false
c.	makes10(1, 9) → true

7-Given a string, take the first 2 chars and return the string with the 2 chars added at both the front and back, so "kitten" yields"kikittenki". If the string length is less than 2, use whatever chars are there.
a.	front22("kitten") → "kikittenki"
b.	front22("Ha") → "HaHaHa"
c.	front22("abc") → "ababcab"

8-Write an angular-based web form with two text inputs and one button. Label your inputs "name" and "phone." When clicked, the button should log the contents of the text input to the console.
